# PocketZot

**Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS) in your pocket.**

**[Play now: pocketzot.app](https://pocketzot.app)**

PocketZot is an unofficial, mobile-first app for playing
[DCSS](https://crawl.develz.org) on an iPhone or Android phone. It's a
[WebTiles](https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto) client. It connects to
standard DCSS servers over the same WebSocket protocol as the official client,
but replaces the rendering and UI entirely: an ASCII-first map, a custom touch
HUD, and on-screen controls designed for portrait mode.

It's also a WebTiles *server*. A full build of DCSS runs on the device itself,
so you can play local games with no network at all. And there's no App Store or
Play Store: it runs in the browser and installs to your home screen as a
Progressive Web App.
