# About PocketZot

PocketZot is an unofficial [DCSS](https://crawl.develz.org) app designed for iOS and Android phones in portrait mode. Play online on public [WebTiles](https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto) servers, or offline with DCSS running entirely on your device.

## Getting started

DCSS has no app on the App Store, but you don't need one: install PocketZot like an app with "Add to Home Screen". Then log in to a WebTiles server and play, or tap "Play offline". iPads and other tablets work too.

## Features

- Custom ASCII-first design that fits the full standard console map onto a phone in portrait mode, with a font still large enough to read
- Offline play support
- Tiles support
- Chat support
- Customizable controls
- Map touch gestures
- Log in with multiple WebTiles server accounts and switch between them
- Inline tap targets in many menus and descriptions
- Context-aware control sets for common situations
- Spectator mode with an expanded map view
- Floating, collapsible monster list; tap to inspect monsters
- 8.6 trillion logos
- Installs to your home screen as a PWA

## Controls

The controls are organized into three tabs: **@**, **>**, and **?**. The mental model is:

- **@** *"micro"* — moment-to-moment actions, including during battle
- **>** *"macro"* — actions often taken outside of battle, or after clearing a floor
- **?** *"info"* — commands to get information about your character or game

Obligatory virtual keyboard also available.

## Gestures

- Tap floating monster list to inspect monsters
- Swipe floating monster list to the other side, or drag it to peek behind
- Tap place name in HUD (e.g. @D:1) to toggle minimap
- Long press on map cell to see what's there
- Tap or drag on map while targeting or examining (`x`) to move the cursor
- Drag level map (`X`) to pan it
- Tap level map (`X`) to place the cursor
- Double tap on map to toggle zoom level
- Two-finger long press on map to toggle ASCII/tiles
- Hold a d-pad direction to shift-move
- Double tap Shift to lock it

## Offline play

Tap the "Play offline" card on the login screen to run DCSS directly on your device with no server, account, or connection required. The first launch installs the engine and tile data as a one-time download. After that, games can start and play even in airplane mode.

Offline characters get named save slots, a past-games list with scores and morgues, an editable options (RC) file, and a Backup feature that exports everything to a single file you can keep or move to another device. Saves live in your browser's storage, which the OS can evict under storage pressure. If a character matters to you, export a backup occasionally.

## Version support

Current stable and trunk DCSS are supported. Versions back to 0.24 generally work; older versions and forks may or may not. In particular, starting a new character on versions before 0.24 doesn't work. Offline play currently ships 0.35-a0.

## Security and privacy

PocketZot has no accounts of its own. Your browser connects directly to your chosen DCSS server over an encrypted WebSocket, just like the desktop WebTiles client. Credentials go only in the login message and are never stored. Saved logins keep the server's session cookie, not your password. The site records anonymous usage counts.

## How it was built

Most of the code was written with Claude Code. The design, product decisions, testing, and review were mine.
