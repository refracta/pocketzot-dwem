# About PocketZot

PocketZot is an unofficial [DCSS](https://crawl.develz.org) [WebTiles](https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto) client designed for phones in portrait mode.

## Features

- Custom ASCII-first design that fits the full standard console map onto a phone in
  portrait mode, with a font still large enough to read
- Tiles support
- Log in with multiple WebTiles server accounts and switch between them
- Inline tap targets in many menus and descriptions
- Context-aware control sets for common situations
- Spectator mode with an expanded map view
- Floating, collapsible monster list; tap for details
- Installs to your home screen as a PWA

## Controls

The controls are organized into three tabs: **@**, **>**, and **?**. The mental model is:

- **@** *"micro"* — moment-to-moment actions, including during battle
- **>** *"macro"* — actions often taken outside of battle, or after clearing a floor
- **?** *"info"* — commands to get information about your character or game

Obligatory virtual keyboard also available.

## Gestures

- Double tap on map to toggle zoom level
- Two-finger long press on map to toggle ASCII/tiles
- Double tap Shift to lock it
- Tap place name in HUD (e.g. @Dungeon:1) to toggle minimap
- Tap floating monster list for full view, then tap monster to inspect
- Tap chevron at top-right of monster list to collapse to single-line view

## Version support

Current stable and trunk DCSS are supported. Versions back to 0.24 generally work; older versions and forks may or may not. In particular, starting a new character on versions before 0.24 doesn't work.

## Security

PocketZot is a static web app with no backend of its own. Your browser connects directly to your chosen DCSS server over an encrypted WebSocket (`wss://`). Your account is a WebTiles account between you and that server — PocketZot has no accounts of its own. Credentials are sent only in the login message and never stored.

### "Resume as …" — what is stored

If the server issues a session cookie, it's stored in `localStorage` under a per-{server, username} key so you can reconnect without re-entering your credentials, until the token expires or is revoked. Logging out invalidates the token on both ends: the server is told to forget it, and the local entry is removed.

## How it was built

Most of the implementation was written with Claude Code, under my direction and review. All design and product decisions, testing, and QA were mine.
