// Silent spell harvest. The player's memorised spells are never pushed
// proactively over WebTiles; they surface only when the `list_spells` menu
// opens (tag:"spell"). We harvest them silently: fire the `I` command
// (CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS → inspect_spells → list_spells(viewing=true) —
// view-only, costs no turn and can't cast), capture the resulting menu
// items, Escape it closed, and never render it. The cache feeds the
// quick-cast spell rail and the touch panel's z tab.
//
// The spell menu is a ToggleableMenu with two column sets: the default
// (schools / failure% / level) arrives in the `menu` message; the alternate
// (power / damage / range / noise) is only the items' `alt_text` and is NOT
// transmitted until a `!` (CMD_MENU_CYCLE_MODE) toggle. We deliberately
// capture only the default set — nothing rendered uses the alternate
// columns, and skipping the toggle halves the harvest's round-trips (and
// with them the input-suppression window). If a UI ever surfaces
// power/damage/noise, re-add the second phase in the same change (it lives
// in git history: `mergeSpellExtra` + the 'extra' harvestPhase).
//
// SpellHarvester is the probe's state machine, extracted from game-view so
// its timer/latch/phase logic is unit-testable in isolation. game-view
// feeds it message-handler events (onMenu / onMsgLine /
// consumePendingClose / reset*) and supplies the environment through
// SpellHarvestHooks; everything DOM-shaped (the rail, the z tab, input
// suppression at the event-handler layer) stays in game-view.
