// Drag a floating card to the left or right edge of its container.
//
// The card's own taps keep working: the recognizer only takes over once the
// finger travels past the tap slop, and then swallows the click the browser
// fires on lift (pointer capture makes lift-outside-the-card still land on
// it, so that click always comes). Below the slop the pointer stream is
// untouched and the card's click handlers see a normal tap.
//
// Capture is taken at the slop crossing, never at touch-down: under pointer
// capture the browser dispatches the lift's click to the CAPTURING element
// (Pointer Events L3, shipped in Chrome and WebKit), so capturing every tap
// would retarget a chevron tap from .ml-toggle to the card — its own handler
// skipped, the card's open-panel handler run instead. Touch has implicit
// capture anyway; the explicit call only matters for a mouse drag — whose
// first move event must still land on the card (a press within the slop
// of an edge, yanked outward, is lost; accepted, this is a thumb gesture).
//
// Settling is by the FINGER's release point, not the card's centre: a wide
// card straddles the midline, and "where did I drop it" reads as where the
// finger is. The card snaps with a FLIP transition — measured before and
// after the caller re-anchors it — so a same-side release slides back and a
// side change slides across instead of teleporting.
