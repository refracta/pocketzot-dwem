// Tap-to-jump for the `X` level map: move the engine's map cursor to a
// tapped cell by synthesizing the keys it would take to walk there.
//
// Why keys: webtiles has no message that moves the level-map cursor.
// `target_cursor` only acts under MOUSE_MODE_TARGET (tileweb.cc
// _handle_cell_target) and the level map never pushes one on webtiles — the
// click-to-move-cursor branch in viewmap.cc's UIMapView::on_event is
// `#ifdef USE_TILE_LOCAL`. A `click_cell` button 1 there would fall into
// _handle_cell_click's COMMAND branch and click-travel from under the map
// UI, which is why the tap gestures send button 3 only (map-tap.ts).
//
// Keys: `hjklyubn` = CMD_MAP_MOVE_* (cmd-keys.h, level-map section), one
// cell each — the diagonal keys cover the shared |dx|,|dy| part, the rest
// goes straight. Singles ONLY, deliberately: the JUMP keys (`HJKLYUBN`,
// `level_map_cursor_step` cells, an RC option) would cut a long hop from
// ~40 keys to ~6, but need the stride measured off a probe key and guarded
// against the engine's clamp — ~120 lines of calibration (commit 8962203)
// for shorter flights. Singles are stride-proof and exact. The whole walk
// goes as ONE `input` message: the server writes a message's text to the
// pty in a single write, so the engine sees it atomically (protocol notes
// in CLAUDE.md). The engine redraws per key (one `cursor` message each,
// traced live), so key count = frames of visible flight.
//
// Clamping: after EVERY map command the engine clamps the cursor
// componentwise to the bounding box of known cells (viewmap.cc
// UIMapView::process_command → clamp_lpos → coord_def::clamped against
// known_map_bounds()). The store holds exactly those cells, so the target
// is clamped to the same box up front (MapStore.mfBounds) — a tap into the
// void walks to the edge, never wastes keys past it.
