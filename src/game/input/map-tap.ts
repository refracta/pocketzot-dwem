// right-click — `click_cell` button 3, describe. There is deliberately no
// left-click mapping: movement stays on the d-pad, so a stray map tap can
// never move the character or fire. In the `X` level map, where the engine
// ignores hover, the drag instead pans the view locally (onPan; policy in
// map-pan.ts) and a tap walks the cursor there (map-jump.ts).
