// Dedupes player-atlas downloads across gamedata versions for doll rendering
// (login strip + crypt). Full background: dev-material/atlas-dedup.md.
//
// The gamedata `version` dir is sha1(install path + crawl version) — NOT
// content-derived — so every trunk rebuild mints a new URL for what is almost
// always a byte-identical player.png, and no two servers ever share a URL.
// The PNGs themselves are unreadable cross-origin (opaque no-CORS images:
// no headers, no bytes, canvas taint). What IS readable is tileinfo-player.js
// (script execution), and it's the thing that gives a recipe's tile ids
// meaning: if two versions enumerate the same absolute-id → sprite-rect
// table, their atlases are interchangeable for dolls (dollLayers emits only
// TEX.PLAYER entries, so the player table alone decides).
//
// So: fingerprint each version by walking its player tileinfo table (~131 KB
// of gzipped JS for the whole dep chain — the same JS a paint loads anyway —
// vs ~1.2 MB + decode for the PNG), cache fingerprints persistently, and let
// one "representative" version's atlas serve every recipe whose version
// shares the fingerprint. A cached fingerprint also lets dolls from a
// GC'd version dir render through a live equivalent without touching the
// dead dir at all.
