// relaunch a crashed PWA from a start-document snapshot MANY deploys old,
// and cold launches don't reliably rewrite that snapshot — so the same
// ancient shell comes back after every crash. Its hash-named chunks are by
// then gone from every layer (old precaches reaped at activate, origin
// rotated → 404), and nothing in the stale page's own code can be updated
// to cope. The service worker is the one component that is always current
// for such a page, so the rescue lives here: a cache-missed /assets/*.js
// request that the network answers 404/410 can only be a stale shell asking
// for a chunk this deploy no longer has — serve STALE_CHUNK_RESCUE_JS in
// its place. Predicate is deliberately tight: script chunks only (a missing
// css/png can't run a recovery), and only definitive not-found statuses —
// network errors and 5xx pass through untouched.

// css/png can't run a recovery, and only hash-named script chunks carry the

// propagate. Deliberately NOT consulted while online — a fresh post-deploy
// page under the still-active old SW requests new-hash chunks foreign to
// the old manifest within milliseconds of HTML parse, before the waiting
// SW's install has even started (registration defers past `load`), so
// membership-before-network misdiagnosed every returning user's first

// The synthetic chunk. Runs in whichever context requested the missing
// script and recovers per context:
// - window (the shell's own <script>/dynamic imports): one reload —
//   a real navigation fetches the current deploy's HTML (or the active
//   SW's own generation-pinned shell offline). Guarded via the SAME
//   sessionStorage key and state semantics as the in-page self-heal
//   (util/self-heal.ts, the canonical explanation): '1' = the last heal
//   reload never booted → a loop, decline; absent or '2' (the last heal
//   booted) → reload and write '1'. Not "once per session": the stale
//   document recurs on every web-process restart of a long-lived tab, and
//   reading any value as latched dead-ended such tabs on every restart
//   (seen live 2026-09-01). When the reload is unavailable (loop, or storage
//   unwritable so no loop guard exists) the script THROWS: the requester
//   must see a failed load — a dynamic import rejects into its error path
//   — never a silently-successful empty module (a bare return resolved
//   import('./offline/boot') with no exports and died as an unhandled
//   TypeError; review catch, 2026-08-17).
// - dedicated worker (the engine worker chunk — the case observed live):
//   a worker can't navigate, but every shell since offline launch speaks
//   the engine-port protocol, so post the standard starred error exit and
//   let the stale shell's own machinery raise its game-ended dialog.
